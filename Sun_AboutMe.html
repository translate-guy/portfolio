        <p>Hello! I'm Dustin Sun, a sophomore in Dublin high school, my career goal is a boss of an internet bar, let the people who don't have a computer can try to design by their own, let them know about engineering and have fun interested in it. I plan to work hard and make money for setting up the internet bar to achieving goals.</p>
        <p>I have been learning in China for a few years. At there, I got third place in a city competition of robot with my team. We work twice a week for 3 months. From design to build than finding ways for faster speed and better performance. We know that nothing is better than persisting in trying time and time again. Never give up must make our project better.></p>
        <p>I don't have any Important accomplishments in my high school years yet, But I will try my best to get all of the accomplishments I can get It.</p>
        <p>That's all, My goal is the boss of the internet bar and I can speak Chinese. Thanks for taking the time reading my Aboutme page! Please explore the rest of my site if you are interested in me.</p>
